hmmm what actually do I want to do? I could make a nn predict the outcome of the battle from a given starting state?

Best board given a bench and opponent character



the characters are in the same place. Take a screenshot then compare it with all of my images and look for the one that is closest?


player log here:
C:\Users\awlego\AppData\LocalLow\Good Luck Games\Storybook Brawl\Player.log

Parse this instead of trying to parse the images if I just want to do the ML on it?!
I could probably just take the tracker code that already deals with parsing it?
